The `WavepoolEffect` plugin makes waves of light splash out from each keypress.
When idle, it will also simulate gentle rainfall on the keyboard.

## Using the plugin

To use the plugin, one needs to include the header and select the effect.

```c++
#include <Kaleidoscope.h>
#include <Kaleidoscope-LED-Wavepool.h>

void setup (){
  Kaleidoscope.use(&WavepoolEffect);

  Kaleidoscope.setup();

  WavepoolEffect.idle_timeout = 5000;  // 5 seconds
  WavepoolEffect.activate();
}
```

It is recommended to place the activation of the plugin (the `USE_PLUGINS` call)
as early as possible, so the plugin can catch all relevant key presses.

## Plugin methods

The plugin provides the `WavepoolEffect` object, which has the following
properties:

### `.idle_timeout`

> When no keys are being pressed, light will periodically splash across
> the keyboard.  This value sets the delay in ms before that starts.
>
> To disable the idle animation entirely, set this to 0.
>
> Default is 5000 (5 seconds).
